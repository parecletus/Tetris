# Tetris

Tetris Duplicate

Before making this tetris game I had no prior knowladge about neither raylib nor c++. (I still don't know anything about c++)
I followed this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVYKG_ch4yM

I tried to understand what he did and I tried to write it in c#. Around minute 50 I completely stopped watching and wrote it by figuring out.
It was fun. I missed using Vector2Int or int2 exc.

It is not perfect. Game over scene to be added. Codes can go through a cleanup. At max music volume songs get dirty.

But it was a small project to understand using raylib and a little c# challenge.

Note: Writing Path as "/Tetris/Songs/.." doesnt work. It has to be written as "Disk:/Users/Tetris/Songs/Somesong.mp3".
